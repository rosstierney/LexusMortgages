            <h2>Why use Lexus Mortgages</h2>

            <p>
                In the rapidly changing mortgage market in Spain, we keep up to date with changes in rates and conditions offered by lenders & ensure the small print is made clear in every case.
                We have access to non high street lenders, so we can offer the most competitive products from the entire market.
            </p>

            <p> Our business is built on trust and we ensure that our clients are protected from unfavourable terms & conditions imposed by Spanish lenders, for example:</p>

            <ol style="list-style:disc">
                <li>
                    Compulsory tie-ins – Such as lump sum life assurance policies added to the mortgage which can add thousands of €uros to your balance
                    Compulsory deposits to guarantee the repayments.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Dual pricing – Where the advertised terms are increased at branch level, or the more profitable IRPH becomes the base rate rather than the Euribor.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Rate floors – In times of low interest rates, you could be prevented from benefitting due to the floor rate, ie. the rate will not fall below a certain level.
                </li>
                <li>   At Lexus Mortgages we endeavour to provide total transparency & and can avoid the pitfalls of choosing a bank at random. </li>
