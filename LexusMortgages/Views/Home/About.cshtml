                        In the rapidly changing mortgage market in Spain, we keep up to date with changes in rates and conditions offered by lenders & ensure the small print is made clear in every case.
                        We have access to non high street lenders, so we can offer the most competitive products from the entire market.
                    </p>

                    <p> Our business is built on trust and we ensure that our clients are protected from unfavourable terms & conditions imposed by Spanish lenders, for example:</p>
                    <div class="col-md-11 col-md-offset-1">
                        <p>
                            <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-ok"></span>
                            Compulsory tie-ins – Such as lump sum life assurance policies added to the mortgage which can add thousands of €uros to your balance
                            Compulsory deposits to guarantee the repayments.
                        </p>

                            <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-ok"></span>
                            Dual pricing – Where the advertised terms are increased at branch level, or the more profitable IRPH becomes the base rate rather than the Euribor.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-ok"></span>
                            Rate floors – In times of low interest rates, you could be prevented from benefitting due to the floor rate, ie. the rate will not fall below a certain level.
                        </p>
